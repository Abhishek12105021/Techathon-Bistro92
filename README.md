# Techathon-Bistro92
Smart restaurant ordering system for Bistro 92. Covers hardware simulation (ESP32 + OLED), backend development, database design, and technical documentation.

## 🌐 Real-Time Integration

- **Wokwi Simulation & Netlify App Integration:**  
  When an order is confirmed via the Wokwi simulation, it automatically updates the Netlify-hosted app in real-time. This integration ensures that every change made in the simulation is reflected instantly in the app interface. As a result, you can see live updates on the order status, which enhances the user experience and provides smooth operation between the simulation and the deployed app.

  - **How It Works:**
    1. When you confirm an order in the Wokwi simulation, the system triggers a request that updates the relevant data.
    2. This data is then transmitted to the backend, and through WebSocket or Server-Sent Events, the Netlify app is updated with the new information.
    3. Users interacting with the Netlify app will see the changes in real time without needing to refresh their browser.

  This seamless connection between the hardware simulation and the deployed application ensures that both the simulated environment and the live app stay synchronized, offering a smooth, dynamic experience.
